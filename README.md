## :nail_care: Building a CV With Gatsby

#### Helloooo everybody! I‚Äôm Ezgi from GNT-Yu. Today I will talk about Gatsby and we will build a basic CV with Gatsby. I hope you would like and enjoy it. Oke, let‚Äôs dig in!


<hr/>

## :honeybee: Intro

First we need to set up our development environment.

<hr/>

## :seedling: Globally Installation

1. Install the `Homebrew`. (To install Gatsby and Node.js on a Mac, it is recommended to use¬†Homebrew.)
2. If you don't have install the `Node.js, npm`. (Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.)
3. Install Git: be able to work with starter templates.
4. Install Gatsby globally on your machine ```install -g gatsby-cli```
5. Create a new site from [Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2) 
 - Choose the one you like or start with a default gatsby starter which is [hello world](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world/)

 ###### TL;DR :bookmark: If you‚Äôre not sure what you installed before then just check from your Commond Line: e.g ``` node --version``` to learn your version. 


## :octocat: Github & Terminal

1. Create a repository named `gatsby-intro`
2. Don't forget to initialize your README file.
3. Clone it to your machine. 
4. Change Directory (This says¬†‚ÄòI want to change directories (cd) to the ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù subfolder‚Äô.¬†.)
5. If you are stuck or lost type on your terminal `gatsby --help` and see the options it gives you. 
6. Start the development mode.. `gatsby develop` This command starts a development server. You will be able to see and interact with your new site in a development environment ‚Äî local (on your computer, not published to the internet)
7. View your site locally: Open up a new tab in your browser and navigate to¬†http://localhost:8000/

8. Your `hello world` **_index.js_** file should be like this:

```import React from "react"

export default function Home() {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>
}

```

  {/* you need to export as React rule. */}.

## :dizzy: Installing Plugins


 

## :art: Give a shape 

1. CSS: We need to work on that but if you feel confident with CSS frameworks then you can implement a framework to your gatsby project. [Tailwind](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tailwind-css/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/).

<hr/>

## üöÄ Deploy your work 

- `npm gatsby build` you need this command to build your project.
- Always push your work on github (at least 3 times in an hour)
- Drag and Drop your `static` file to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop), so we can see your CV easily!

<hr/>

## Well done! Nice job :clap:
